    <section>
        <h2>Introduction:</h2>
        <p>C++ was developed by <strong>Bjarne Stroustrup</strong> at Bell Labs during the early 1980s. It was designed to support the features of C such as <strong>efficiency</strong> & low-level support for system coding. New features added were classes with inheritance & virtual functions, were inspired from <strong>Simula67</strong> language, & <strong>Operator overloading</strong> was inspired from <strong>Algol68</strong>. Described as <strong>superset of C</strong>, C++ has full support for <strong>object-oriented programming (OOPs)</strong>.</p>

    <!-- Getting Started -->
    <section>
        <h2>Getting Started:</h2>
        <p>To write any C++ Program, you need a text editor. Text editor allows you to create & modify text files (<strong>Notepad++</strong>, <strong>Sublime</strong>, etc). After writing the code we must make sure that it is error-free, this process is known as <strong>Compilation</strong> & <strong>Compiler</strong> is used to make sure that our code is error-free. It converts the code into machine understandable code (object code) & also displays syntax errors (if present) in the program.</p>
        <p>C++ programs can be created using any text editor. Some systems like <strong>Visual Studio</strong> & <strong>Code::Blocks</strong> provide an integrated program development environment under different operating systems (like Windows, Linux). IDE Provides a built-in text editor & a compiler. C++ programs can be also compiled using command-line tools (like <strong>g++</strong> & <strong>clang++</strong>).</p>

    <!-- Sample Program-->
    <section>
		<h2>Writing a Simple C++ Program:</h2>
		<div class="code">
          <pre>
<span class="header">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;</span>

<span class="function">int main()</span> {
  <span class="keyword">cout</span> &lt;&lt "Hello, World.";
  <span class="keyword">return</span> 0;
}        </pre>
       </div>
       
       <br>
       
       <h4>Program Explanation:</h4>
       <p>Here the <span class="highlight header">#include &lt;iostream&gt;</span> in the program deals with including of header file (iostream  is Input-Output Stream, also known as Preprocessor Directive) it is needed to support all built-in functions like <span class="highlight keyword">cout</span> (in this example), <span class="highlight header">using namespace std;</span> allows us to access elements from Standard C++ Library.</p>
       <p>The the fourth line is the Main Function within the body of which you start writing the code for your program. Every C++ Program must include one & only one main function.</p>
       <p>The code written between the curly braces { } is the program body, the 5th line will output the text enclosed in quotation marks ("") on the console. The sixth line <span class="highlight keyword">return 0;</span> is used to indicate that the program is executed successfully.</p>
       
       <br>
       
       <h4>Program Output:</h4>
       <div class="code">
		   <pre>
Hello, World.		   
		   </pre>
       </div>

    <!-- Data Types -->
    <section>
		<h2>Data Types in C++:</h2>
		<p>The chart below shows various data types in C++,</p>
	    <a href="images/data-types.png"><img class="data-types" src="images/data-types.png"></a>
	  
        <br>
        <br>
		
		<h4>Basic Datatypes</h4>
		<ol type="1">
	      <li><strong>int:</strong> It stands for 'integer' and is used to represent whole numbers.</li>
          <li><strong>char:</strong> It stands for 'character' and is used to represent characters such as letters.</li>
          <li><strong>float:</strong> It is used to represent decimal numbers with upto 6-7 digits.</li>
          <li><strong>double:</strong> It is similar to float but can hold more decimal places with upto 15-16 digits.</li>
          <li><strong>void:</strong> It is used as the return type for functions that do not return a value.</li>
        </ol>

    <!-- Variables -->
    <section>
    	<h2>Variables in C++:</h2>
        <p>Variables are used to store information/data. The data stored in a variable can be changed during program execution. In C++ all variables must be declared before use.</p>
        
        <br>
        	
        <h4>Rules for Declaring Variables in C++:</h4>
        <ol type="i">
        	<li>Variable names must start with a letter (A to Z) & (a to z).</li>
        	<li>Data type must be specified before declaring the variable name.</li> 
            <li>Keywords (like <span class="highlight keyword">int</span>, <span class="highlight keyword">float</span>, <span class="highlight keyword">return</span>, <span class="highlight keyword">char</span>) cannot be used as variables name.</li>   
            <li>Variables with two same names can't be declared.</li>
            <li>Variables cannot contain whitespaces.</li>
            <li>Variables cannot contain special characters except underscores.</li>
        </ol>  
        
        <br>
        	
        <h4>Syntax for Declaration of a Variable:</h4>
        <div class="code">
        	<pre>
<span class="keyword">datatype</span> <span class="variable">variable_name</span>; 
</pre>
        </div>
        
        <br>
        	
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <div class="code">
          <pre>
<span class="header">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;</span>

<span class="function">int main()</span> {
  <span class="keyword">int</span> <span class="variable">myVar</span> = 58;  
  <span class="comment">//Declares a variable named myVar & 
  assigns integer value of 58 to it.</span>
  <span class="keyword">return</span> 0;
}        </pre>
    </section>
    
    <hr>
  	
    <!-- Constants -->
    <section>
    	<h2>Constants:</h2>
        <p>Constants are declared with the <strong>"const"</strong> keyword, a type, their name, and an assignment of their constant value. This value must match the declared type, & its fixed (constant) for the duration of the programs.</p>
        
        <br>
        	
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <div class="code">
        	<pre>
<span class="header">#include &lt;iostream&gt;
using namespace std;</span>

<span class="function">int main()</span> {
  <span class="keyword">const int</span> <span class="variable">pie</span> = 3.14;  
  <span class="comment">//Declares a constant named pie and
  assigns integer value of 3.14 to it.</span>
  <span class="keyword">return</span> 0;
}        </pre> 
        </div>
